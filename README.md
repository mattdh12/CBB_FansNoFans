A/B test of the 2019-2020 and the 2020-2021 college basketball season

The goal of this module is to essentially see if fans make an impact on college basketball games and how much if so.

The 2020-2021 season did not allow fans into stadiums due to the pandemic. This gives a unique opportunity to compare stadiums with fans vs without fans and see if there's an impact.

The data is from the free version of Sports Data IO. The free version randomly modifies the actual data to encourage users to buy the paid version, but the data is not modified enough to actually affect the summary statistics.

The end result found that, on average, fans were worth about 1.5 points for the home team. This information could be helpful for coaches planning their upcoming schedules. This information could also be helpful to sports bettors.

A more interesting case would be to measure how many points each individual fan is worth. Thinking about this briefly, this should not be a flat constant value. For example, having infinite fans packed into a stadium does not guarantee victory for the home team. It would be more interesting to see the fans/no fans comparison for each stadium though. It was beyond the scope for this project, but that may be looked at in the future.
